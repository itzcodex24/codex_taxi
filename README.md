**_Coming Soon!_**

<h1 align="center">[vRP] Codex Taxi 🚕</h1>


> What is this script about? 
* This script can be used for players to select one of 2 locations 🗺️ or a custom waypoint 📍! (_Defaults: Dealership, City Hall_)
* **NOTE 📝:** You will be able to change these locations coords and names from the `config.lua` file as well as the `index.html` file!

> What is the UI like?
* The UIs main functionality is to allow players to select a location 🗺️, by presenting them with a cool animation!
* The UI then sends this information to the client side where the main script functionality is written!
* See some pictures of the design below!


> What other things does this script bring to the table?
* This script should not allow Trigger Spammers 🧾 or anything of the kind to crash a player or the server. 

> Other scripts of mine:
* [Codex FindPlayer](https://github.com/itzcodex24/codex_findPlayer) **[V2 Coming Soon]**

[^note]:
     I will not be releasing a version 2 of this script any time soon or at all. If the script for some odd reason does not work for you, or you may have other suggestions, feel        free to contact me on discord at codex.exe#0001 📞
