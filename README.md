> What is this script about? 
* This script can be used for players to select one of 2 locations 🗺️ or a custom waypoint 📍! (_Defaults: Dealership, City Hall_)
* **NOTE 📝:** You will be able to change these locations coords and names from the `config.lua` file as well as the `index.html` file!

> What is the UI like?
* The UIs main functionality is to allow players to select a location 🗺️, by presenting them with a cool animation!
* The UI then sends this information to the client side where the main script functionality is written!
* See some pictures of the design below!


> What other things does this script bring to the table?
* This script should not allow Trigger Spammers 🧾 or anything of the kind to crash a player or the server. 

> Other scripts of mine:
* [Codex FindPlayer](https://github.com/itzcodex24/codex_findPlayer) **[V2 Coming Soon]**

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
