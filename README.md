> What is this script about? 
* This script can be used for players to select one of 2 locations 🗺️ or a custom waypoint 📍! (_Defaults: Dealership, City Hall_)
* **NOTE 📝:** You will be able to change these locations coords and names from the `config.lua` file as well as the `index.html` file!

> What is the UI like?
* The UIs main functionality is to allow players to select a location 🗺️, by presenting them with a cool animation!
* The UI then sends this information to the client side where the main script functionality is written!
* See some pictures of the design below!


> What other things does this script bring to the table?
* This script should not allow Trigger Spammers 🧾 or anything of the kind to crash a player or the server. 

> Extra Information:
* **NOTE 📝:** I am not, and do not plan to work on a second version of this script unless there is something huge I can add! If you have any suggestions, feel free to dm them to me on discord at `codex.exe#0001` 📞
